It's a simple,self-contained authentication and authorization service.All of the api of the service are thread save.While the api are called,they return an integer code as a result as far as possible.Otherwise,we use a simple class named Result<?> to package the result,which field named "status" indicates the operation is success or not.And while success,you can achieve the real result by accessing the field which name is "retObj".

# Dependency
We use junit to develop our test casesï¼Œbeside of that,it's designed based on standard JDK,that doesn't use other libraries.

# Here are the values of the return code:
| code value  | description |
| ------------- | ------------- |

| 10000  | normally an exception occurses  |
| 10001  | the user already exists  |
